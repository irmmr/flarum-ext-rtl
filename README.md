<center><h4>Flarum RTL extension</h4></center>

This extension is for adding RTL support to Flarum. Unlike previous versions, you no longer need to write additional `LESS/CSS` for your forum.

This extension tries to change the directions from `LTR` to `RTL` as much as possible.
This project focuses on the Flarum core user interface and other known extensions.

### Install

Installation is like all flarum extensions.

```
composer require irmmr/flarum-ext-rtl
```

You can also use the latest changes.

```
composer require irmmr/flarum-ext-rtl:dev-main
```

### Update

```
composer update irmmr/flarum-ext-rtl
```

This plugin adds an RTL version alongside all compiled CSS files. While using this method has many advantages, it can also come with some issues. If you encounter a serious problem while using this plugin, you can visit the `issue` section.
